      <h4>Patience</h4>
      <p>Like many things in life things take time. Relationships, career, wealth, and skills. <br>As the saying goes
        "Rome wasn't built in a year", you're going to have to be patient with yourself. 
      </p>

      <p>A personal example on patience from me is learning a new instrument, like the piano. At first you think its going to be easy 
        until you sit down and figure out its not. You learn what the keys are, then graduate to playing chords, then playing your
        first song. Soon enough you've dove deep in it's been a year since you touched the keyboard. Learning coding
        can be the same way with patience.  
      </p>

      <h4>Consistecy</h4>
      <p>Whenever you start something new the first thing to do usually to learn the terminology and equipment
        used for that skill. Strength building or working out for example. To do it right and to actually build 
        muscle you need to know what excersies help with which muscle. When done at a constent bases results will 
        show.  
      </p>

      <p>With coding its the same way. When you do it constantly that skill, or technique will stick in your brain
        and it will be second nature.
