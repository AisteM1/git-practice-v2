          <h3>Give yourself a break</h3>
          <p>When you start out programming we tend to be hard on ourselves if we don't get the concepts right away.
            This is a new language full of challenge, opportunity & fun.</p>
          <p>Make space in your journey to work at something that didn't come out as planned. After all, the more
            your fingers touch the keys, the more practice you have under your belt! Sooooo, not getting it the 1st
            time is actually good. It helps you work through issues by being resourceful and getting to digging
            deeper. Go for it - I know you can do it!</p>

          <h3>Prepare to be uncomfortable</h3>
          <p>We are in the business of learning technology and those technologies are always evolving and upgrading.
            Knowing upfront that having the uncomfortable feeling that you kinda, almost get the code you are
            looking at, but not understand HOW exactly it's happening is a completely normal phase.</p>
          <p>In fact, it's a critical part of the process. This helps train your eye to read code, especially since
            you are going to be reading a lot of it. Knowing this that uncomfortableness ebbs and flows will allow
            you to focus on truly taking in the skill and exercising persistence to get to what comes next.</p>

          <h3>Grab a coding buddy</h3>
          <p>Having someone to share your journey with really makes a difference. Whether that's being super active
            in the Skillcrush community or having a friend (or group of friends) work through the lessons makes
            learning to code that much more fun.</p>
          <p>It also gives you another person's perspective and you can review each others code, especially when
            you get stuck.</p>
