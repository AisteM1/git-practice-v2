      <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
      <p>When you start programming your first web app, you're doing something you've never done
        before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
        so specific it's probably never been done before.</p>

      <p>Confusion means you're heading in the right direction. It's a signal you've engaged in the 
        problem-solving pursuit of math and technology and it's time for you to dig deeper. 
        Don't stop now, coding padawan. Keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

      <h4>Suspended disbelief also plays an important role!</h4>
      <p>When learning a new technology, whether it's writing your first programming
        language or just the latest framework, you'll go through an uncomfortable phase where it seems
        the code you're looking at is doing SOMETHING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
      </p>

      <p>This is a normal, and critical, part of the process of learning a new technology.</p>

      <p>When you encounter a new programming language, part of your learning process includes training 
        your eye. The way to do this is to read a lot of code, even if you don't totally understand 
        what it does.</p>
