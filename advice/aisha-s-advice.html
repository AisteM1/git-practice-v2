      <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
      <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
        before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
        so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

      <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
        have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
        to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

      <h4>Go over your work again.</h4>
      <p>If you need to go over what you are learning a first or second time please do so. You can forget from time to 
        time and need to refresh. </p>

      <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
        of the process.</p>

        <h4>On days you don't feel like it</h4>
      <p>On days you don't feel like coding go ahead and try anyway. You will find that after a while you will enjoy it and find it rewarding.
        Don't also feel gulity for not wanting to learn, it's part of the journey.</p>
        
      <p>Don't be afraid to make mistakes and take breaks when needed.</p>
