      <h4>It isn't just you!</h4>
      <p>You aren't alone in the hard place. Learning a brand new way of thinking is hard for everybody. 
        If you haven't ever done coding before, the world you are entering is one that is completely different 
        from any you have known before. (My first experience getting on Discord was a black screen set up 
        by a teenager-I thought I had entered Knockturn Alley.)</p>

        <h4>You will be okay!</h4>
      <p>The Skillcrush staff is gentle and patient. There is no shaming or derision. You may learn at your 
        own pace and comfort levels. the only thing pushing you is your own drive. </p>

      <h4>You've got this!</h4>
