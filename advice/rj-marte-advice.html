      <h4>Accept that things being new and scary is fine!</h4>
      <p>Any time you start something new there comes a potential <em>mountain</em> of material that will seem
        completely foreign and, potentially, overwhelming. And that's totally fine!</p>

        alt="woman fist-pumping shouting courage">

      <h4>Focus on each individual step rather than the full journey</h4>
      <p>Like I said in the previous section, learning something new can feel overwhelming. The best way to overcome
        that feeling is to focus on the step you're currently at, rather than the whole of the journey itself.
      </p>

      <p>This way, instead of that same mountain, you're only focusing on each crack or rock you're stepping over. A
        much easier challenge to overcome, wouldn't you say?</p>
