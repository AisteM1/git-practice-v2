      <h4>Don't get caught speeding!</h4>
      <p> I don't know why I am being asked to give advice, I'm only six weeks into the program. There's a lot to experience in this course,
         but don't get in a hurry. Take the time to understand what is presented in each class. At the very least, make sure that you have 
         a good idea of what you don't understand so when it comes up in another lesson, you'll be ready.
