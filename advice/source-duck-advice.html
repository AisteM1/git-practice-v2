                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shoshin (Japanese: 初心) is a concept from Zen Buddhism meaning beginner's mind. It refers to
                        having an attitude
                        of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when studying, even at an advanced level,
                        just as a
                        beginner would. The term is especially used in the study of Zen Buddhism and Japanese martial
                        arts,[1] and was
                        popularized outside of Japan by Shunryū Suzuki's 1970 book Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind.</p>

                    <p>The practice of shoshin acts as a counter to the hubris and closed-mindedness often associated
                        with thinking
                        of oneself as an expert.[2] This includes the Einstellung effect, where a person becomes so
                        accustomed to a
                        certain way of doing things that they do not consider or acknowledge new ideas or approaches.[3]
                        The word
                        shoshin is a combination of sho (Japanese: 初), meaning "beginner" or "initial", and shin
                        (Japanese: 心),
                        meaning "mind".[4]</p><br>
                    <p>Other uses</p>
                    <p>The concept of shoshin is used in the art of Japanese calligraphy in the context of Zen, where
                        each stroke is made as though the calligrapher were a beginner to the art.[5]: 14  In Japanese
                        calligraphy shoshin is not an aesthetic choice, but rather a state of mind of the practitioner,
                        one that addresses and counters the paradox within calligraphy where the more one practices, the
                        more the quality of the calligraphy may suffer.[16]</p>
                    <p>Shoshin is described as the first of the states of mind or stages of Budō.[17] Shoshin
                        (beginner's mind) is followed by Mushin (empty mind), Fudōshin (immovable mind), and Zanshin
                        (remaining mind).[18] A fifth state is sometimes also added as Senshin (enlightened mind).[19]
                        In Budō the practitioner is advised to retain shoshin throughout their training and practice of
                        the martial arts; it is not reserved only for those beginning to practice but is maintained even
                        when reaching the higher levels of mastery.[17] Shoshin-sha is a term used in martial arts to
                        indicate a novice.[12]</p>
                    <p>Shoshin is an influence on the Japanese Metabolism style of architecture, which incorporates
                        concepts from Zen Buddhism and other Asian philosophical traditions into the architectural
                        process and allows those concepts to help shape the design process.[20] Many businesses and
                        people who work in the field of business have adopted or advocate for practicing the concept of
                        shoshin in the business environment,[21][8][9] including top executives such as Apple Inc.'s
                        founder and CEO Steve Jobs, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.[22] It is also used or proposed as
                        a way of general living[23] or a way to approach specific fields of life including social
                        work,[24] medical care,[25] teaching,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin"
